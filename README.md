# ***This project is no longer maintained and has been archived.***

This project is being archived because it can no longer be maintained for the following reasons:
- It has become difficult to circumvent bot countermeasures due to changes in Twitter (X) specifications.
- The number of response patterns has increased, making it difficult to dynamically extract response patterns.
- The developer can no longer dedicate time to this project.
- Approaches using browser automation like Puppeteer are being replaced by methods that directly call internal APIs.

We are very grateful for the many people who starred this repository and for the fact that some repositories had dependencies on it.  
Thank you for everything❤
